## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

âœ¨ I'm a Developer from Hungary passionate about technology. I'm currently learning C++ and Python, aiming to pursue a career in software/game development or cybersecurity. Always eager to build, break, and learn more!
ðŸ’» I have experience in web development, though it's not the field I want to pursue long-term. I'm much more passionate about building systems, games, or exploring the world of cybersecurity.
