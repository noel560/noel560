## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

âœ¨ I'm a developer from Hungary with a strong curiosity for how things work under the hood. Currently diving deep into C++ and Python, with the goal of building a career in software development, game programming, or cybersecurity.

ðŸ’» I have experience in web development, though it's not the field I want to pursue long-term. I'm much more passionate about building systems, games, or exploring the world of cybersecurity.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m on a journey to become a well-rounded developer, and plan to explore Rust, Bash scripting, and C in the near future.
